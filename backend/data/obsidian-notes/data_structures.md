# Data Structures Overview

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data efficiently.

## Linear Data Structures

### Arrays
- Fixed size collection of elements
- O(1) access time
- O(n) insertion/deletion

### Linked Lists
- Dynamic size
- O(n) access time
- O(1) insertion/deletion at head

### Stacks
- LIFO (Last In, First Out)
- Operations: push, pop, peek
- Used in: function calls, expression evaluation

### Queues
- FIFO (First In, First Out)
- Operations: enqueue, dequeue
- Used in: BFS, task scheduling

## Non-Linear Data Structures

### Trees
- Hierarchical structure
- Binary trees, BSTs, AVL trees
- Used in: file systems, databases

### Graphs
- Vertices and edges
- Directed vs undirected
- Algorithms: [[BFS]], [[DFS]], [[Dijkstra]]
