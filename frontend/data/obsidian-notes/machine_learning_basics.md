# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: classification, regression
- Algorithms: [[Linear Regression]], [[Decision Trees]]

### Unsupervised Learning
- Finds patterns in unlabeled data
- Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction
- Algorithms: K-means, PCA

### Reinforcement Learning
- Agent learns through interaction with environment
- Reward/punishment system
- Examples: game playing, robotics

## Key Concepts

**Training Data**: Dataset used to train the model
**Features**: Input variables used to make predictions
**Labels**: Target outputs for supervised learning
**Model**: Mathematical representation of a real-world process
